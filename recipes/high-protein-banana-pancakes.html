    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>These pancakes are so good, they'll surely satisfy any sweet tooth. Once you try them, you'll be shocked to know they're <em>actually</em> good for you!</p>

    <h2>ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 T butter</li>
        <li>1 tsp. cinnamon</li>
        <li>1 <em>super</em> ripe banana (the riper the banana, the sweeter the pancakes</li>
        <li>2 eggs</li>
        <li>1 T honey</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Allow skillet to heat on medium for 2 min</li>
        <li>While your skillet is coming to temp, mash your banana and mix in the eggs and cinnamon</li>
        <li>Once your skillet is ready, put just enough butter to prevent sticking and pour a small amount of batter into the pan (these are more flimsy than regular pancakes, I found it's easier to flip them if they are a little smaller)</li>
        <li>When you see them begin to bubble in the middle, they're ready to flip</li>
        <li>After about 1-2 minutes, they should be done, repeat steps 3-4 until batter is gone</li>
        <li>Drizzle with honey and enjoy!</li>

    </ol>
